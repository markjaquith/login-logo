Requires at least: 3.3  
Tested up to: 5.2.1 

Customize the logo on the WP login screen by simply dropping a file named login-logo.png into your WP content directory. CSS is automatic!

## Description ##

This plugin allows you to customize the logo on the WordPress login screen. There is zero configuration. You just drop the logo file into your WordPress content directory, named `login-logo.png` and this plugin takes over.

Note that you should use a transparent background on the PNG image, crop it tightly (no padding pixels) and use a width of exactly 312 pixels for best results. Wider images will be downscaled in modern browsers, but it isn't recommended to rely on that.

This plugin also works in the `mu-plugins` directory.

## Installation ##

1. [Click here](http://coveredwebservices.com/wp-plugin-install/?plugin=login-logo) to install and activate.

2. Create a PNG image with a transparent background, tightly cropped, with a recommended width of 312 pixels.

3. Upload the PNG image to your WordPress content directory (`/wp-content/`, by default), and name the file `login-logo.png`.

4. If you have a multisite install with more than one network, you can also use `login-logo-network-{NETWORK ID}.png` to assign a different login logo to each network.

5. If you have a multisite install, you can also use `login-logo-site-{$blog_id}.png` to assign a different login logo to each site.

6. Done! The login screen will now use your logo.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Why does my image look strange in IE or an outdated browser? ###

Your image is probably too wide. Wide images are scaled down in IE 9 or other modern browsers, but not in older browsers. Use an image that is no more than 312 pixels wide.
